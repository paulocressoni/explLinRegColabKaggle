# Using Google Drive and Kaggle Api in Google Colab Notebooks

We are going to perform data analysis and linear regression on the [House Prices Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) downloaded via kaggle API call inside the notebook. The IDE we're using is the [Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to access our Google Drive.

The details are in the notebooks themselves.
