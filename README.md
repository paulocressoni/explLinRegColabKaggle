# Using Google Drive API and Kaggle API in Google Colab Notebooks

We are going to perform data analysis and linear regression on the [House Prices Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) downloaded via kaggle API call inside the notebook. The IDE we're using is the [Google Colab notebooks IDE](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and we're going to access our Google Drive to store and retrieve data used in the notebooks.

- The **Google Colab is an IDE** as simple as Jupyter is to use. The nice thing about it is that **it runs on browser, provides more processing power and memory than conventional laptops** and it is also possible to **use GPU and TPU to run your notebooks**. All is very simple and easy to use, and the best of all, it's **FREE**. You can use Google Colab just as an IDE and connect to a local kernel of jupyter whether you want to as well.

- Kaggle is a Data Science platform that stores a lot of datasets. We'll learn to **download a dataset from Kaggle** using the it's **API inside our notebook**. 

- Afterwards, we'll work on this data and use our **Google Drive to store our cleaned data**. We'll use **Google Drive API** for that.

- After we **downloaded, explored, cleaned and stored the data**, we'll create a **linear model** just for fun. :nerd_face:

The details are in the notebooks themselves. You can follow the notebooks on the order below:

1. [Comprehensive Data Exploration with Python](https://github.com/paulocressoni/explLinRegColabKaggle/blob/master/comprehensive_data_exploration_with_python.ipynb)
2. [Linear Models](https://github.com/paulocressoni/explLinRegColabKaggle/blob/master/Linear_models_after_data_exploration.ipynb)

Keep on Learning! :mechanical_arm:
